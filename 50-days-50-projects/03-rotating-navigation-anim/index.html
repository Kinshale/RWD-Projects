        <h1>Crime and Punishment</h1>
        <small>A psychological masterclass</small>
        <p>
          Crime and Punishment is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor
          Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian
          Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later
          published in a single volume. <br />Raskolnikov, a destitute and
          desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg
          and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines
          himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose
          beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game
          of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is
          pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of
          his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden
          sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.

        <p>
          Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky was a Russian novelist, journalist,
          short story writer, philosopher and essayist. His literary works
          explore psychology in the political, social, and spiritual turmoil of
          19th-century Russia. His writings reveal a wide range of philosophical
          and religious themes. Dostoyevsky is best known for the novels,
          <b>The Brothers Karamasov</b>, <b>The Idiot</b>, and above all,
          <b>Crime and Punishment</b>. He has left his mark, still strong a
          century and a half after his death, on the world of Russian literature
          with a multitude of scholars studying his works. Russian websites are
          dominated by discussions about Dostoyevsky. Visitors to St Petersburg
          find a Dostoyevsky site related either to his life or the settings of
          his novels around every corner. One of the reasons for Dostoyevsyâ€™s
          enduring cultural importance is that he addressed aspects of Russian
          life in his time, which were no less relevant to the Soviet Russia to
          come and, now again, in twenty-first century Russia. He prophesied the
          totalitarianism of the Soviet period. Many of the social problems that
          preoccupied him and ran strongly through his philosophical, essay and
          fictional writing are still of concern in modern Russia -- the issues
          of poverty, crime, gambling, alcoholism, family disintegration, child
          abuse. Those were his recurrent themes.
